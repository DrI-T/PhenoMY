## Gitcoin Project with Quadratic public good funding

Most clinical studies that substantiate the tools, diagnostics and therapies we use in healthcare have been conducted on men. Historically, the rationale for inclusion of only men in our clinical studies was to reduce the statistical impact of the biochemical variability of the female hormone cycle. But we missed something important. We lost sight of how the female hormones impact disease risk, diagnostic interpretation and therapeutic response. The effect of changing hormones on health, well-being and longevity were nearly ignored. With PhenomX Health, we are raising awareness about the health gender gap and empowering women to take charge of their hormonal health with precision nutrition based on her symptoms and non-invasive biomarkers of health. Her health data are placed on the blockchain for accelerating learning with an open data model that respects privacy principles.

Our project addresses anonymization of data, public encryption, multi party computation within the smart-contract and off chain distributed oracles, and of course health tokenomics.

Women make 80% of the health decisions in their families. Our platform has a large potential public impact, while allowing an easier adoption of our solution due to a smaller addressable space.
