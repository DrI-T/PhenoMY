## Gitcoin Project with Quadratic public good funding


Most clinical studies that substantiate the tools, diagnostics and
therapies we use in healthcare have been conducted on men. Historically,
the rationale for inclusion of only men in our clinical studies was
to reduce the statistical impact of the biochemical variability of the
female hormone cycle. But we missed something important. We lost sight of
how the female hormones impact disease risk, diagnostic interpretation
and therapeutic response. The effect of changing hormones on health,
well-being and longevity were nearly ignored. With PhenomX Health Project,
we are raising awareness about the health gender gap and empowering women to
take charge of their hormonal health with precision nutrition based on
her symptoms and non-invasive biomarkers of health. Her health data are
placed on the blockchain for accelerating learning with an open data
model that respects privacy principles.

Our project addresses anonymization of data, public encryption, multi
party computation within the smart-contract and off chain distributed
oracles.

When make 80% of the health decisions in their families; and 37% of the
world's population will be menopausal by 2025. This large, addressable
market will help us reach the tipping point required for adoption.
