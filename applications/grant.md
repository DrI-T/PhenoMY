Most clinical study are made on men. we want to raise awareness about health gender gap and empower women about hormonal health via precision nutrition based on her symptoms and inputs. Our plan is to put health data on the blockchain for accelerating the learning with an open data model that still respect privacy principles.

Our project would address anonymization of data, public encryption, multi party computation within smart-contract and off chain distributed oracles.

We choose women as our initial public as it has been documented that they are the health decision makers in families and therefore we optimize our impact while still having an addressable size public, which will help us to reach the tipping point, when we seek adoption.
