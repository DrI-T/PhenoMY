Did you know”
A list of interesting facts that I can pick and choose from

Hot flash category -
You are more likely to have hot flashes when your blood sugar is low.
Do you notice that you have more hot flashhs after having milk, cheese or yogurt?

Try peppermint tea and peppermint essential oil the next time you hot flash
