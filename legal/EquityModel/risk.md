- The uppermost layer will consist of the early founders of the firm. They may be one, two, or more individuals, but the idea is that they all started to work at the same time. This means that they all incurred the same risks of leaving their jobs to venture into the unknown, starting the new company.
- The second layer is comprised of the first real employees. By the time the founder is bringing in these people, he already sees a small amount of money flowing in and out, be it from investors or regular clients. The employees don’t risk as much as the founders did, as they’re guaranteed salaries or wages right off the bat.
- The third layer consists of employees who are recruited much later. By this time, the firm is doing pretty well and probably making profits.

For the majority of organizations, each layer takes about one year. So by the time the firm expands to the point of going public, it has five or more layers of employees.


Now, when dividing equity, the very first founders should get at least 50% of the company.
Each of the subsequent layers should receive 10% of the company, which
is then divided equally among all the employees in that layer.



year0: C+M: > 50%
year1: J+F+L.. = 10%
year2: 15      = 10%
year3: 30      = 10%
year4: 45      = 10%
year5: 60      = 10%

And never enter into a partnership or start a new company without a written agreement that covers all your bases.
