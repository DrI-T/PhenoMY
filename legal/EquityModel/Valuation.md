## PhenomX Valuation


## rules of thumb:

similar app: the clue ap. ~20M at year 5 (except market is wider)
multiplication factor: 5x

20M / 5 = 4M 
50% tech, 50% nutrition = blockchain = 2M for IP w/ long term value of 10M

10/35 = 28% (pic: 15M)
10/30 = 33% (pic: 15M)

I honnor PhenomX w/ transformative tech of equivalent value of 28%,
if CTO equity < 28% require complementary retribution: licensing, cash, salary, convertible loan etc.

Valuing a pre-seed startup can be challenging because the company may
not yet have significant revenue or assets, and there may be limited
data available to use as a basis for the valuation.

Here are some steps you can follow to try to estimate the value of a pre-seed startup:

1. Consider the stage of the company: Pre-seed startups are typically
   very early in their development, with little or no revenue and a product
   that may still be in the prototype or development stage. This can make
   it difficult to apply traditional valuation methods, such as discounted
   cash flow analysis or the price-to-earnings ratio.

2. Review the company's business plan and financial projections: The
   business plan and financial projections should provide some insight into
   the company's expected growth and revenue potential. These projections
   can be used to estimate the value of the company based on its future
   cash flows.

3. Assess the market opportunity: Consider the size of the market in
   which the company operates and the potential demand for its product or
   service. A larger market opportunity may suggest a higher valuation.

4. Consider the company's competitive advantage: If the company has a
   unique product or service, or a strong competitive advantage, this may
   increase its value.

5. Look at comparable companies: If there are other companies in the same
   industry that have received funding at similar stages of development,
   you can use their valuations as a benchmark. However, be aware that
   every company is different, and the valuation of one company may not be
   directly comparable to another.

It's important to note that valuing a pre-seed startup is an inherently
subjective process and can be difficult to do with a high degree of
accuracy. There are many variables to consider, and it's possible that
different investors will arrive at very different valuations for the
same company.

The cost to replicate a company's product or service can be one factor to consider when valuing a startup. If it would be relatively inexpensive for a competitor to replicate the company's offering, this may indicate a lower valuation for the startup. On the other hand, if the company has developed a unique product or service that would be difficult or expensive for a competitor to replicate, this may increase its value.

It's important to keep in mind that the cost to replicate a company's offering is just one factor among many that can affect its valuation. Other factors to consider may include the size of the market opportunity, the company's competitive advantage, its financial projections, and the valuations of comparable companies.

It's also worth noting that the cost to replicate a company's offering may not always be easy to estimate. In some cases, the company may have patented technology or other intellectual property that can make it more difficult for competitors to enter the market. In other cases, the company may have built strong relationships with customers or suppliers that could be difficult for a competitor to replicate.
