Startup investing is a relationship game. With the thousands of other companies out there raising money, why should an investor put their money with you? The more you can build a relationship with potential investors, the better shot you’ll have at convincing them to give you money. It’s no mistake that many VCs say “team” is the most important consideration when evaluating a company. Do they think the team can deliver on its promises? By starting conversations early, you can let the potential investor know what you are about and what you plan to accomplish before fundraising. Then when you meet with them again when you start the process, you can show them that you delivered. This helps them “derisk” their investment.

>The quick version of my “[15 ways a VC says no][no]” post is that until you get a term sheet, or even better, the check clears, consider it a “no.” That doesn’t mean you shouldn’t keep working on them. I’ve turned some rejections into commitments in later rounds. Just be mindful that a “no” comes in many forms while a yes comes in one — cash in the bank.
