## innovation

[[PhenomX Vision]] technology uses direct inputs from its users to deliver recommendation.
It is important in an uncontrolled environment to have adequate filter to remove
noise,
we tokenized the data to allow advance filtering therefore guatanteeing the quality of our database.
<!-- internal translation: data of paid users are marked as trustworthy data for AI to learn on -->

We run our recommendation engine in a direct feedback loop to integrate user data in real time so
that we can provide "to the point" recommendation that our user can try to address their symptoms
and as opposed to other application in the space, we place a lot of importance to follow up
and to get in the field optimisation and direct learning for what work and what does not.
Making Phenomx program the only one totally tuned for the user state.

privacy aware technology

  - successful collection of user health data is directly tied to the level of 
    trust the user has in the application and the company not to misuse the data
  - we go an extra length to store the data in a "provable" safe manner.
  - we use asymetric cryptography to secure at rest all data
  - we use distributed ledger technology to provide temper proof security
  - our technology stack allow to deployement of peer to peer database without
    any organization needing custody of the data.
  - phenomx is able to make the provable claim:
    - Phenomx doesn't have access to patient data
    - the data owner has data-access sole control
