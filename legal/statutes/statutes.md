<!--
Comments: This article represents the heart of the association. Its drafting must therefore be considered very carefully.
Article 74 https://www.cagi.ch/wp-content/uploads/2020_-modele_Statuts_CAGI.pdfCC provides that no member may be forced against his or her will to accept a change in the objects (i.e. the purpose) of the association, which means that the amendment of the association’s purpose requires the agreement of each member, unless the statutes provide otherwise.
 
In order to allow for a certain flexibility in the evolution of the association, without having to go through a modification of the statutes, it is recommended to provide for a broad description of the purpose and to include the practical aspects of implementation of the purpose in the following article, referred to as “means”.
 
In order for an association to qualify for a tax exemption, it must pursue either a public purpose, a public service or a religious purpose (art. 56(g) and (h) LIFD and art. 9(1)(f) and (g) LIPM). Since the purpose is analysed particularly with regards to the general conception of the collectivity, this article should be drafted in such a way that every citizen should understand the activities to be carried out by the association, and therefore, the interest for the collectivity to support it. For more information, see the Geneva tax authorities’ guide.

## II. MEMBERS

It is also possible to provide for categories of members in the statutes, defining their rights and obligations (e.g. categories without voting rights, or without obligation to pay membership fees). Examples of categories of members include : founding members, active, passive, honorary, associates, etc.
-->

### Art. 7 BEGINNING OF MEMBERSHIP

The founders are the initial Members of the Company.
Additional Members may join the Company by submittion a written application to
the founding members. The steering commiteed shall review the applications and vote for approval.

<!--
Comments : The method of appointing members can be freely chosen. The principle is that the General Assembly has the primary power to appoint members (art. 65 para. 1 CC), but a distinct body could be designated in the statutes for this purpose. The ability to admit and exclude members could therefore be delegated, for example tohttps://www.cagi.ch/wp-content/uploads/2020_-modele_Statuts_CAGI.pdf the Board, if the statutes so provide explicitly. The possibilities of appeal to the General Assembly remain open in such cases.
-->

### Art. 8 END OF MEMBERSHIP

Membership ceases: 

- Upon the resignation of the Member addressed to the Board at least 3 months before the end of the calendar year (art. 70 para. 2 CC);
- Upon death of the Member if such Member is an individual and not the representative of an institution (art. 70 al. 3 CC); or
- By exclusion decided by the General Assembly, [(i) for the following reasons […] or (ii) without cause].

- A resigning or expelled Member has no right to the Company’s assets.

<!--
Comments : in accordance with article 70 para. 2 CC, all members are entitled by law to leave an association.
The exclusion of a member is regulated by article 72 CC. Generally speaking, there are two options available to associations in order to exclude their members. Thus, the statutes may provide for :
 
(i) exclusion on statutory grounds (art. 72 para. 1, 1st sentence CC). In such a case, the statutes may determine the grounds for exclusion (e.g. any conduct that would harm the association, a violation of the statutes, non-payment of fees, etc.), or
 
ii) the exclusion may take place without giving any reasons / without cause (art. 72 para. 1, 2nd sentence CC).
 
See article 73 CC for the effects of the exit or the exclusion of a member.
 
The fact that a leaving member has no right to the association’s assets is necessary in order to meet the condition of “irrevocable and exclusive allocation of the association’s funds to its purpose of public utility, public service or religious purpose”, which is necessary in order to obtain tax exemption.
