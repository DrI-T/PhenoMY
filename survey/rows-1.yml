  - "- I would add a sleep tracking or would ask to input sleep time/hours to make
    sure there is (or not) a sleep schedule/routine;\n- Is sexual life important ?
    Does it have an impact on symptoms and general mood ? \n- Weight is also a concern
    at this stage. I would be curious to know if fluctuations can be explained with
    hormonal patterns. Add a weight tracker ?\n- Workout and gym ? \n- I'm willing
    to input data on my general feelings/symptoms, not sure I want to spend time also
    adding daily details on diet and hormones (it sound very time consuming to me)"

  - You are welcome, such an app could be a great preventive tool for women who believe
    they are not yet even in pre menopause, while this stage can come more quickly
    than thought, and entails symptoms that usually are not even diagnosed well by
    GPs (they make unnecessary neuro tests when headaches come, or believe there is
    a problem of stress), if the app could in some ways with functionalities other
    than official menopause such as nutritional /healthy recommendations for various
    ages, that helps onboarding earlier the women users 40-70
