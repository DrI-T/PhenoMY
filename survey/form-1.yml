BF037: You are welcome, such an app could be a great preventive tool for women who
  believe they are not yet even in pre menopause, while this stage can come more quickly
  than thought, and entails symptoms that usually are not even diagnosed well by GPs
  (they make unnecessary neuro tests when headaches come, or believe there is a problem
  of stress), if the app could in some ways with functionalities other than official
  menopause such as nutritional /healthy recommendations for various ages, that helps
  onboarding earlier the women users 40-70
